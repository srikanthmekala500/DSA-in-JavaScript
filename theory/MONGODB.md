## What is Database? 

  - A database is an **organized collection of data**, so that it can be **easily accessed and managed**.
  
  - The main purpose of the database is to **operate a large amount of information by storing, retrieving, and managing data.**
    
## What is MongoDB?

- MongoDB is a **cross-platform document-based database**. Categorized as a NoSQL database, **MongoDB avoids the conventional table-oriented relational database structure in support of the JSON-like documents with the dynamic schemas,** making the data integration in specific kinds of applications quicker and simpler.

- It stores the data in the form of the BSON structure-oriented databases. We store these documents in a collection

**It's Key Features are:**

- Document Oriented and NoSQL database.
  
- Supports Aggregation
  
-  Uses BSON format
 
-  Sharding (Helps in Horizontal Scalability)

-  Supports Ad Hoc Queries
-  Schema Less
-  Capped Collection
-  Indexing (Any field in MongoDB can be indexed)
-  MongoDB Replica Set (Provides high availability)
-  Supports Multiple Storage Engines
  
**Scaling horizontally** ===> Thousands of minions will do the work together for you.

**Scaling vertically** ===> One big hulk will do all the work for you.

Horizontal scaling means that you scale by adding more machines into your pool of resources whereas Vertical scaling means that you scale by adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing machine.Scaling horizontally ===> Thousands of minions will do the work together for you.
