## What is ReactJS?
- React is a front-end and open-source JavaScript library which is useful in developing user interfaces specifically for applications with a single page. It is helpful in building complex and reusable user interface(UI) components of mobile and web applications as it follows the component-based approach.

**The important features of React are:**

- It supports server-side rendering.
- It will make use of the virtual DOM rather than real DOM (Data Object Model) as RealDOM manipulations are expensive.
- It follows unidirectional data binding or data flow.
- It uses reusable or composable UI components for developing the view.
