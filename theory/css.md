## What is a Sprite

- Sprites are two-dimensional images which are made up of combining small images into one larger image at defined X and Y coordinates.

- To display a single image from the combined image, you could use the CSS background-position property, defining the exact position of the image to be displayed.

**Advantage of Using CSS Image Sprite**

- A web page with many images, particularly many small images, such as icons, buttons, etc. can take a long time to load and generates multiple server requests.

- Using the image sprites instead of separate images will significantly reduce the number of HTTP requests a browser makes to the server, which can be very effective for improving the loading time of web pages and overall site performance.
