## Endocrine System: Anatomy and Physiology
  The endocrine system is a network of glands and organs that produce, store, and secrete hormones. These hormones regulate various physiological processes in the body, such as growth, metabolism, reproduction, and homeostasis.
# Functions of the Endocrine System
Regulation of Metabolism: Controls how the body uses energy.
Homeostasis: Maintains internal balance (e.g., blood glucose levels, blood pressure).
Growth and Development: Regulates tissue and skeletal growth.
Reproduction: Controls reproductive processes and cycles.
Stress Response: Manages reactions to physical and emotional stress.
