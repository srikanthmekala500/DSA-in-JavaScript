## Endocrine System: Anatomy and Physiology
  The endocrine system is a network of glands and organs that produce, store, and secrete hormones. These hormones regulate various physiological processes in the body, such as growth, metabolism, reproduction, and homeostasis.
  
**Functions of the Endocrine System**

  **Regulation of Metabolism:** Controls how the body uses energy.
   **Homeostasis:** Maintains internal balance (e.g., blood glucose levels, blood pressure).
  
  **Growth and Development:** Regulates tissue and skeletal growth.
    
  **Reproduction:** Controls reproductive processes and cycles.
    
  **Stress Response:** Manages reactions to physical and emotional stress.
    
    
**Two types of glands in body**

    – Exocrine glands and endocrine glands
    
**• Exocrine glands**

– Release secretions into duct that carries them to
  outside of body
  
– Example: sweat glands

**• Endocrine glands**

– Release hormones directly into bloodstream

– Have no ducts, referred to as ductless glands

– Example: thyroid gland
