**Incidents and deviations** are key terms used in quality control and assurance, especially in regulated industries like pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and manufacturing. Both terms relate to unexpected or unplanned events, but they differ in context and significance.

**1. Incident**

**An incident is an unplanned event or occurrence that happens during a process or operation but does not directly impact product quality, safety, or compliance.** It is usually considered less critical than a deviation and may not require extensive investigation or corrective actions unless it happens frequently or escalates.

**Key Points:**
   - Nature: Minor, unexpected events that don't directly affect product quality or regulatory compliance.
**Examples:**

  - A temporary power failure that didn’t affect production or testing.
  
  - Minor equipment malfunctions that are quickly resolved with no impact on processes or results.
  
**Action:** Incidents are usually logged and monitored to ensure that they don’t escalate into deviations. Repeated incidents may require corrective actions or preventive measures.

**2. Deviation**

**A deviation is a departure from standard operating procedures (SOPs), protocols, or established guidelines that has the potential to affect product quality, safety, or compliance with regulations.** Deviations are generally more critical than incidents and require investigation to determine the root cause, impact, and corrective actions.

**Key Points:**

  - **Nature:** A deviation involves non-conformance to approved procedures, specifications, or standards.
  
**Examples:**
 - A batch process not following the validated steps of production.
  
 - Use of incorrect materials or failure to follow SOPs during testing or production.
      
- Environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity) exceeding acceptable limits in cleanroom or storage areas.
    
**Action:** Deviations require a formal investigation to identify the cause and assess the impact on product quality or patient safety. Corrective and preventive actions (CAPAs) are typically required to prevent future deviations.

**Incidents** are unexpected events with no direct quality impact.

**Deviations** are more serious, involving departures from approved processes that could affect quality or compliance.

**What Are the Different Types of Deviation ?**
   - In general, your organization will encounter two types of deviations:

- Planned Deviations
- Unplanned Deviations

**1.Planned Deviations:**

 - Planned deviations refer to pre-approved and intentional deviations from standard procedures or processes.

- These deviations are **planned and justified in advance, serving various purposes, such as process improvement, method validation, and temporary process changes**.

**Some examples of planned deviations include:**

- Implementing a temporary manufacturing process change to test and validate potential efficiency improvements.
  
- Using an alternative raw material as part of a trial to assess its suitability without affecting product quality.
  
- Temporarily adopting an alternative testing method to validate its accuracy and reliability compared to the standard method

**2.Unplanned Deviations:**

- Unplanned deviations refer to a departure from approved procedures without prior notice or intention.

- Various factors, such as equipment malfunction, employee error, environmental events, or others, can cause them.

- Unplanned deviations can significantly impact product quality and safety, and such deviations should be investigated promptly to identify the root cause and prevent them from happening again.

**Some examples of unplanned deviations include:**

- The sudden breakdown of manufacturing equipment leads to deviations from standard operating conditions and affects product quality.
  
- Deviations are caused by unforeseen events like power outages, extreme weather conditions, or natural disasters that disrupt manufacturing.
  
- Accidental introduction of foreign materials into the production process, leading to material contamination and deviation from product specifications.
