**Incidents and deviations** are key terms used in quality control and assurance, especially in regulated industries like pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and manufacturing. Both terms relate to unexpected or unplanned events, but they differ in context and significance.

**1. Incident**

**An incident is an unplanned event or occurrence that happens during a process or operation but does not directly impact product quality, safety, or compliance.** It is usually considered less critical than a deviation and may not require extensive investigation or corrective actions unless it happens frequently or escalates.

**Key Points:**
   - Nature: Minor, unexpected events that don't directly affect product quality or regulatory compliance.
**Examples:**

  - A temporary power failure that didn’t affect production or testing.
  
  - Minor equipment malfunctions that are quickly resolved with no impact on processes or results.
  
**Action:** Incidents are usually logged and monitored to ensure that they don’t escalate into deviations. Repeated incidents may require corrective actions or preventive measures.

**2. Deviation**

**A deviation is a departure from standard operating procedures (SOPs), protocols, or established guidelines that has the potential to affect product quality, safety, or compliance with regulations.** Deviations are generally more critical than incidents and require investigation to determine the root cause, impact, and corrective actions.

**Key Points:**

  - **Nature:** A deviation involves non-conformance to approved procedures, specifications, or standards.
  
**Examples:**
 - A batch process not following the validated steps of production.
  
 - Use of incorrect materials or failure to follow SOPs during testing or production.
      
- Environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity) exceeding acceptable limits in cleanroom or storage areas.
    
**Action:** Deviations require a formal investigation to identify the cause and assess the impact on product quality or patient safety. Corrective and preventive actions (CAPAs) are typically required to prevent future deviations.
