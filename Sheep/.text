What's Already Excellent:
Clear weekly and daily feeding plan

Thorough health and treatment schedule

Practical biosecurity steps

Realistic growth targets

Checklist format for accountability

🔧 Recommended Additions / Improvements
🥼 1. Vitamin Supplementation (Often Overlooked)
Add Vitamin ADE injections at 3.5–4 months if lambs show slow growth or weak legs.

Especially helpful during the rainy season or if animals are housed indoors often.

Task	When	Dosage
Vitamin ADE	3.5–4 months	1–2 ml IM per lamb (as per label)

🌿 2. Anti-Bloat Precautions
If lambs are eating lush Desmanthus or legumes, bloat can be a risk:

Add anti-bloat liquid to water (e.g. poloxalene) or

Offer small amounts of rough straw (100–200 g) in the morning to reduce risk

📋 3. Body Condition Scoring (BCS)
Every 2 weeks, visually and manually check BCS on a 1–5 scale.

Goal BCS: 3.0–3.5

<2.5 = Underfed

4 = Overfat, reduces feed efficiency

Helps fine-tune feed and prevent over/underfeeding.

🧪 4. Fecal Egg Count (FEC) Monitoring
If possible, perform a FEC test every 6–8 weeks to decide if deworming is truly needed.

Prevents drug resistance

Can be done by vet or animal health worker

🌾 5. Pasture Access (If Available)
If lambs can graze in addition to stall feed:

1–2 hours daily grazing boosts health and feed variety

Reduces cost of green fodder

Watch for parasite risk (keep rotation & avoid wet grazing)

📱 6. Record Keeping Suggestion
Encourage simple data tracking:

Date	Weight	BCS	Treatments	Feed Issues	Notes
01-Aug	17.5 kg	3.0	Dewormed (Albendazole)	OK	–

This helps spot patterns early (e.g., feed not working, repeat illness).

⚖️ 7. Pre-Sale Preparation Tips (Final Month)
Wash/scrub lambs gently with warm water to improve coat shine

Clip hooves and clean ear tags

Give 7–10 days of extra mash/molasses if needed for finish
